# Detect_DDoS-Attack-using-EntropyComputing
Entropy-based detection algorithm was carried out using POX controller in different tests that include 
using different networks and different number of controllers. From the results it is noticed that the 
Entropy detection algorithm detects lower than threshold Entropy values and block attack packets and 
only keep normal packets.
