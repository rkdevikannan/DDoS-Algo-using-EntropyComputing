# Detect_DDoS-Attack-using-EntropyComputing
Entropy-based detection algorithm was carried out using POX controller in different tests that include 
using different networks and different number of controllers. From the results it is noticed that the 
Entropy detection algorithm detects lower than threshold Entropy values and block attack packets and 
only keep normal packets.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Entropy detection algorithm has been implemented in 8 GB Laptop with installed Windows 8.1 (64- bit); 
and Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit) virtual machine were installed in Virtual Box with 5000 MB base memory; and 
a package of Mininet was installed in this virtual machine as the emulation tool. Mininet is a network 
emulator.The controller in which the algorithm was run is POX; POX is an open source controller written in python 
programming language
